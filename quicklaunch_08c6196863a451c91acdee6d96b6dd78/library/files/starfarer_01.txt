Log 1: Hear Your Babies Crying.

I know I should feel bad. I’m so lucky right now. There are still millions of people starving back there on Earth, and I’m up here. Safe… or at least, sorta safe. Or at least, if I starve it’ll be my own dumb fault which is a lot more than most people can say right now.

I like the guys I’m working with, too. Victor, Hamilton, Cutter, Sandy… so far we’re getting along great. Cutter can be kinda cranky and Sandy’s obviously seen some stuff that she doesn’t want to talk about, but so far we’re all in a good mood and working well together. Right now we’re all sleeping in a single dormitory and Hamilton snores like a sawmill, so I’ll be glad when we can spare the time to build separate cabins for everyone…

But really? His snoring is the worst of my concerns. That’s… it’s been a long time since I had it so good.

The first and most important step in building a ship is naming her. We decided to go with “Starfarer.” Hopefully a name like that will carry us a long way. We’re… kinda divided on what we’re going to do exactly. I think Victor and Sandy feel we owe it to the Haven Foundation to put in a real and serious search for Eden.

I think we need to take care of ourselves first. If we look out for each other and work with other Haven crews and just take it carefully, we should be fine. Maybe we’ll find Eden along the way!

If we don’t… well, just having a safe place to sleep and regular food on the table in front of me every day suits me just fine. I don’t need fame and adventure. A home is enough.

Though, I guess I’d better get back to building her. There’s still a lot of work to do before she’s really self-sufficient.
