Log 1: Where the wind takes us

Personal log, first entry. Captain Michael Raymond of the good ship Tranquility speaking.

Wonder if I should feel guilty about how glad I was to see the back of Earth? Ain’t prob’ly never gonna see it again, and good riddance. Whole place was... troubling. An’ that’s puttin’ it mildly. 

Sure ain’t gonna miss ranchin’ cattle only to have ‘em all stolen an’ slaughtered by starving refugees. Idiots didn’t leave no breeding stock, meanin’ no more cows, meanin’ no more food... Safe bet they turned to eatin’ each other in the end.

Still… Tranquility ain’t exactly a step up from the ranch. I’m gonna miss big open skies and the wind in my face, that’s for sure. And I’m really gonna miss my dog…

But hell, I’m alive and we got food and good crew... Ain’t my concern if Katie wants to sleep next to the power core, or Glass keeps readin’ the same Bible over an’ over again like he’s tryin’ to memorize it. 

An’ Sam? I ain’t never looked at a woman the way Sam looks at his rifle. He even named the damn thing, which is just weird. But I’m glad he’s on my side.

I guess we’ll just go where the wind takes us, so to speak, and do our best to scratch out a livin’. We ain’t the first folks to try an’ make somethin’ of a new frontier. We won’t be the last, either. It won’t be easy, but… we can do it.
