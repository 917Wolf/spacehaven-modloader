Log 4: Respectable persons of business

Things are goin’ pretty smooth. We’ve made a name for ourselves, and expanded Tranquility’s cargo hold. Took on a posse of extra crew, too. Buncha misfits, but so long as they pull their weight an’ shoot straight they’re family.

It’s startin’ to get how the biggest complaint folks have about us is how we’re on the move all the time, makes us harder to find. I guess I can see the point. Ain’t like the ultramart back home hopped around like a jackrabbit. We’ve had customers complain they near ran outta gas tryin’ to catch up to us and buy gas.

We ain’t opportunistic traders no more. We’re respectable persons of business. Folks come to us for a fair deal, ‘cuz they know we got what they need. A reputation like that means we don’t need to fly around lookin’ no more, the business comes to us.

Maybe it’s time to find someplace we’re easily found and stop moving. I think I saw a good spot a ways back.

...Yeah, here it is. <Coordinates attached>. 

Seems to me like if we head over there and park up, we can be where the folks lookin’ for us can find us. 

And at that point… Might as well just go ahead an’ sell the engines, I guess.
