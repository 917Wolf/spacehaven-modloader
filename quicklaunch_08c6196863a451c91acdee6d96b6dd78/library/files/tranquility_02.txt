Log 2: Awful empty in my sky.

Things are goin’ well. Got more crates of electronics than we know what to do with, but that’s like the opposite of a problem. Except… it ain’t, because that’s space in the hold could be full of somethin’ we actually need. Like water, or hyperfuel.

I mean… What do you do when you have too much of something? You sell it, right? And you buy what you don’t have. That’s trade!

Can’t do that out here. Ain’t nobody around to sell to or buy from. But Sam reckons you have to be as dumb as a horse to leave resources lyin’ around when you find ‘em, and he’s right. So we brought over a stack of crates from that wreck we found yesterday and now our hold is full of even more electronics we don’t need and Katie’s still chunterin’ on about how we need more sticks for the core.

There’s gotta be some folks somewhere out here who’ve got more power rods than they know what to do with. And maybe they need circuit boards! Or maybe they need fruit! We’ve got lotsa fruit. Yeah. There’s gotta be someone out here we can trade with...

Guess the tricky part is findin’ em.
