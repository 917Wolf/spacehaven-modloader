Log 3: Going Boldly.

I still think Chang’s too… I don’t know. Cautious, I guess. I don’t think he’d be happy unless we stuffed the hold full of everything we can get our hands on, and even then he’d probably  fret.

I told him; the longer we stay in one place, the more likely we are somebody’ll come along and there’s no guarantee they’ll be friendly. The quicker we move, the safer we are. He said all the safety in the world won’t help if we run out of energy sticks.

I asked him how many we have. Fifteen he said. That’s plenty, so I’m not worried.

He got his chance, though. We stopped and built that survey station, and he personally mined every rock the pods could reach. He’s still complaining, but whatever. We’ll be here for a while as the telescope does its thing, we can probably sweep this whole system clean before it’s done.

I hope it doesn’t take too long though. I have to admit, part of the rush is I want to go down in history as the crew that found Eden. The history books won’t remember the runners-up. I want to get there FIRST.

Blondie’s still giving me grief, though. Keeps arguing about “humanity’s track record” and how we were  a “mass extinction event” and how we have no right to do that to a second planet. Brown said we have no right to let millions of people die. It’s getting to be a problem, and the worst part is that I can’t do a bloody thing to fix it because I’m firmly on one team. There isn’t a neutral third party on board, just four of us who think we should find Eden, and one who thinks we shouldn’t.

In the end I just told him to face the inevitable. “Somebody’s going to find the bloody thing first,” I said. “So it may as well be us.”

He’s reading in his bunk again. Hopefully it calms him down.
