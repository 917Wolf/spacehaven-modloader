Log 5: Light The Way Back Home.

I’ve been so busy, I’ve forgotten to keep my personal journal updated. In fact come to think of it, I might just call this the final entry. I have too many plates to spin, it’s probably a bad idea to add one more. Still… this little story deserves an ending.

We made more friends. That’s the short version. 

+Laughs+ That’s… oversimplifying it.  But how do I even begin to compress all those adventures into one log entry? All the lives we saved, all the scrapes we got into. All the days we barely survived by our fingertips… and those of us who didn’t survive at all.

We lost Cutter. A stroke. It could have been worse: we nearly lost him to slavery. There’s a lot of people in the fleet who wouldn’t still have all their bits if Cutter hadn’t been there to put them back together.

Yes, I said fleet. Dozens of us, by now. A genuine nomad caravan of Earth’s flotsam. We’ve had to start getting picky about who we let in. Too many crews turned out to be slavers, or pirates, or cultists…  It hurts to look starving people in the eye and turn them away, but I have hundreds of lives to worry about who earned their place in this caravan. Hundreds of mouths to feed, and there’s never enough to spare on charity. 

I wish that was different. Maybe one day it will be.

I’m… going to give this journal to some of those desperate souls. Who knows, maybe word will spread. We can handle pirates, and maybe there are folks out there who don’t need charity. Maybe there’s folks who made it, somehow.

If that’s you? If you can pull your weight and help keep those mouths fed and those ships flying? Maybe there’s a spot for you in our caravan.

After all: Home is where the heart is.

This is Emily Lopez, captain of the independent haven craft “Starfarer,” signing off.
