Log 2: Straight On Until Morning.

Chang thinks I’m crazy. He said, “Floyd, you’re asking us to look for one small straw-coloured needle in a whole field of haystacks.” I told him it was something to focus on, at least. You’ve got to have a mission, right? You don’t just drift through life, you set your sights on something and work at it. 

At least Chef and Brown were on my side. Blondie…

Well, his exact words were “we already fucked up one planet, what gives us the right to ruin a second one?” I told him, I think we’ve learned from our mistakes. He didn’t seem convinced but in the end he accepted he was out-voted and went to go read in his bunk.

Maybe Eden is a big wild goose chase, but it gives us a purpose at least. Chang and Brown nodded when I said that. Chef grumbled something about slowing down and picking over everything we can find at each stop before we move on, but personally I like the pace we’re setting. It keeps us ahead of all the other ships following behind us from Earth. The odd hyperspace message that reaches us says a lot of ship crews went rogue. You hear talk of them turning corrupt or violent, even crazy. 

Heading out this way, in a direction not many are going and just grabbing what we need before we move on? It keeps us safe. If we build enough of a lead, maybe it’ll be safe to stop and build a deep-sky survey satellite. We can’t just rely on stumbling across Eden, Chang’s right there. We’ll have to look for it.

Just a few more jumps, first…
