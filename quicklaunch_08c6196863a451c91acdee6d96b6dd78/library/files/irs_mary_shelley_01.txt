Log 1: A great and sudden change.

Independent Research Ship Mary Shelley, first log entry. Captain Grant Park speaking.

Or should I keep calling myself “Professor?” Perhaps not. This is a ship, not a university after all… though there’s no reason it can’t be both I suppose.  

I brought a couple of colleagues with me - Anderson and Fletcher - plus a pair of doctorate students, Chase and Ray… Good people. Not just ivory-tower academics, but genuine talent. And of course, Chase and Ray sharing a cabin saves space for other things.

The Mary Shelley is… basic, to say the least. But she flies, she’s well-stocked and she has everything she needs to sustain us. We can expand her on the fly to suit any mission profile… All we really need now is a direction. 

I’ve given that a lot of thought as we prepared for this. In all this excitement over what everyone’s so grandiosely calling the “apocalypse,” they all got so hung up on finding a new home, or a new planet, that they’ve forgotten what space exploration is really about: To seek out new worlds and… well, you know the rest. To boldly split infinitives that no man has split before! +chuckles+

Who knows. Maybe the answer to our problems is an older, wiser species who faced the same troubles we did and overcame them… or perhaps they were smart enough to see them coming in the first place. We can’t fail to learn more about the cosmos if we go looking… and who knows, perhaps we’ll stumble across what all the other ships are looking for along the way.

Or, just maybe, we’ll actually make first contact.

Either way… This should be interesting.
