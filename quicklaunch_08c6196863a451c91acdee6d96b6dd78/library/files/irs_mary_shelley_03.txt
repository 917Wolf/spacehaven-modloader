Log 3: Determined heart and resolved will.

First contact. I still can’t believe it really happened. We’ve found the first truly hard, physical evidence of a non-human civilization: A spaceship.

Sadly it was derelict, and there was no sign of the crew. We’ve formulated some theories about what they may have looked like based on the furniture, and they definitely weren’t humanoid. Anderson thinks they may have been quadrupedal. 

We’re trying to guess how old the wreck might be, but failing. How do you begin dating something from another planet? Impossible! There wasn’t enough organic matter aboard the ship for radiometric dating, and even if there was we don’t have the necessary baseline information for an alien world! It could be thousands of years old for all we know. Tens of thousands! The people who built it might all be gone. Who knows?! Maybe the apocalypse is something that happens to every species, in time.

There was one light in the darkness, though. Literally. A single functioning, powered piece of technology. It’s bigger than two men: We had to literally strap it to the shuttle to bring it back over to the Mary Shelley, but it’s here now, sitting in the middle of our deck. We have no idea where to even begin. We’re going to do our best, I guess. And our best is very, very good.

Speaking of which... I won’t learn anything if I sit here complaining into my log, will I? Up and at ‘em, Park: there’s science to do.
