Log 4: Land Ahoy!

We got a good contact from the telescope. Right kind of mass, orbital radius and atmosphere composition at least. It’s a ways out, right on the edge of the telescope’s range, but we can make it.

I told the guys to do a full systems check, make sure everything’s ship-shape for a long sequence of interstellar hops. Ten minutes later, Blondie got in a fight with Chang. Knocked him out cold! So while Chef was bandaging Chang’s boo-boo, I had to confine Blondie to his cabin. He’s in there right now, sulking and reading that bloody book of his again. 

I asked Chang what it was about. He mumbled something about the inventory report, but he’s high as a kite right now and Chef says he’s got a nasty concussion. He might not even remember.

...I guess I’d better go check on Blondie, see what he says. Wish me luck.

Blondie gave me an earful, as expected. He just won’t let go. Started ranting some crazy shit at me about “The Poison Eden” and a “great step backwards.” I thought he was gonna have a go at me too!

So… yeah. He’s still confined to quarters. At least until Chang recovers and we get his side of the story. I asked Brown about the inventory situation. He checked the bridge comp, says we’re good on everything. We could be a little more comfortable on energy sticks, but there’s no crystals left in this system, and telescope says there’s plenty of crystals around our destination.

We’re so CLOSE now, I can almost taste it.  Eden. It’s out there, and we’re going to find it.

Just three jumps. Three days.

This is going to be huge, I just know it.
