Log 4: Keepers Of The Flames.

Victor’s friends could have been anything. Pirates, slavers… Instead they turned out to be some of the nicest folks I’ve ever met. I guess the apocalypse just can’t take the shine off some people.

Nice, but not pushovers. I wouldn’t want to be the pirate that messes with the crew of the “Second Chance.”

We teamed up. Where we go, they go. Everything gets split fifty/fifty, and if one crew’s a little short on supplies, the other crew’s there for them. It sounds a lot simpler than it is, but it works. I’ll choose a negotiation over a gunfight every time.

It’s already paid off, too. I’m pretty sure that ship we were seeing for the last four or five jumps was stalking us. Since we teamed up with the “Second Chance,” they’ve vanished. 

So, we’re gonna keep doing what we were doing. Follow the resources. I hear other crews have big ideas about searching for a new homeworld, or alien life, or whatever. They’re welcome to it. All I care about is keeping me and mine alive and honest. All other concerns are secondary.

Sandy said she had some friends on another ship that might be out this way. It worked out well enough with the “Second Chance,” so… yeah. Maybe we should go see if the crew of “Perfect Ship v.3.0” live up to their sense of humor.

So long as they can pull their weight, they’ll be welcome.
