Log 2: They Try And Break Me.

We have to eat, and breathe. No water means neither food nor air. So, we’ll follow the ice asteroids. 

Or the metal asteroids, when we’re running short on tools and building blocks to keep the ship maintained. Or power crystals, when we’re running short on energy sticks... 

The point is, if we just go where the things we need are, we should be fine. Simple, right?

Well, yeah it’s simple. Which means a bunch of other people thought of it too. And I guess some of them thought they could just...

I don’t know how we’re all still alive. It was a close thing, way too close. If Sandy had still been in the hydroponics bay when that missile hit… or if  Hamilton hadn’t been such a good shot… or if Cutter wasn’t such a damn good surgeon…

...We made it. We had to kill four men, but we made it. And then we held a funeral for them, even though we didn’t know their names. We mourned the pirates who tried to murder us... Why do I feel so guilty about defending myself?

I’d hoped the apocalypse would bring us together, get us all pulling in the same direction. You know? I guess I didn’t learn from the example of my parents. They hoarded what they had, and never let anyone in… and in the end, a mob broke down their front door and took it all anyway. 

I wonder if maybe the key is to share. Not, like, stupidly. I don’t mean starving ourselves, and God knows that’s firmly on the cards for a few days now that we had to rebuild the grow beds and plant new crops… 

But I mean like… if somebody comes to you with an empty belly and you feed them, then that’s a debt, or, or a bond. They’re with you then. They’re your friend.

Despite what happened, I don’t want to lose faith. I have to believe this galaxy is big enough for all of us. Earth wasn’t, but…

...I have to believe.
