Log 4: A secret, which I desired to discover.

Fascinating. Truly fascinating. The artefact appears to be a combination of an exotic hyperspace signal transmitter, and some kind of incubation chamber, or maybe a suspended animation pod that doesn’t rely on cryostasis. Maybe both. And it has an occupant!

The creature within exhibits truly remarkable adaptations that can’t possibly be natural. I don’t know if this thing even needs to breathe air! But of course, that raises so many questions. It looks designed, but who designs a life form that can survive and work in space? 

That’s definitely what’s going on here. The… biodroid? Creature? Whatever it is, it has an organ in its brain that’s sensitive to the hyperspace signals from the artefact. We tried pushing a few different buttons to see if we could get a response, but nothing’s happened so far.

That’s hardly surprising. We’re trying to operate a piece of technology that runs on completely different principles to everything invented by the human race. All their standards and protocols are different, right down to the voltages, circuit architecture and… everything! We’re poking blind at this thing, but I think Chase and Ray are making some inroads on translation. I don’t care if they aren’t making progress really, watching the way those two smile as they work together always lifts my spirits.

If they succeed, though, I bet this creature would be just as compliant as any robot. But why not just build a robot?

Sadly, that question will have to wait: Fletcher says this system is running low on available water. We’ll move on to somewhere we can stay a little longer and build a containment pen on the ship where we can study the organism properly. We have a good lead on a relatively wealthy system along the derelict alien ship’s trajectory. Maybe we’ll find something out that way.

I’ve attached the navigation data to this log entry. Can’t have too many backups, after all...
