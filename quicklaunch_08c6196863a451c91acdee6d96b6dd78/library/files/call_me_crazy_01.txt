Log 1: Second Star To The Right

So, um… this is HSS Call Me Crazy, ship’s log, first entry, Captain Floyd Pierce. I thought I should probably start keeping one now that we’ve got an actual ship that can fly. We got the hyperdrive installed today, which means we’re all set to leave! Eden here we come!

...Brown thinks I’m too optimistic. I just like to think, y’know… things are so dark right now, us little lights have to shine that much brighter.

Yeah, you too mate. +laughs+ He just gave me the finger. Anyway, um...

I mean, it was bad down there. Really bloody bad. London’s basically underwater nowadays, and the week before we finally got the shuttle up to our haven, I swear I saw a body floating down the street. I’m glad I don’t have to deal with that any longer. I feel bad for the poor sods we left behind, but there’s only so quickly this program can work, isn’t there? 

It’s only going to get worse before it gets better. And it’ll just keep getting worse unless people have somewhere to go…

All the boards and social media are buzzing with this… rumour? Idea? I’m not sure which. But they all imagine there’s a planet out there somewhere, one that’s enough like Earth that we could live there. It has to be pretty exact: it needs the right gravity, the right air, the right… lots of things. 

But it’s a big galaxy. There’s got to be a planet like that out there somewhere, right?

People online are calling it “Eden.” And I guess that’s our mission. We can’t keep living on these ships forever, can we? No. We need a planet. And we… I think we learned from Earth how to keep from messing up a new one. We were just behind the curve with Earth. 

Eden will be different. We just have to find it. So… that’s what we’re going to do.
