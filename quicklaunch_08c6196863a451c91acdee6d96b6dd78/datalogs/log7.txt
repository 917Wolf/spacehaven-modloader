Oh...kaaaay? I think I screwed up.

Oh, shut up Val. You TOTALLY screwed up.

...Yeah, going it alone wasn’t such a great idea after all. It’s driven me totally crazy. Except… No. I’m not crazy, I just, um… talk to myself. A lot.

I mean, what’s a girl to do, right? There’s nobody around for a few trillion miles. Gotta have someone to talk to. Right?

Right you are, Val.

The problem is… One person is NOT enough to run a spaceship. I can talk to myself all the livelong day, but I can’t be in two places at once. Can’t sleep and eat at the same time, can’t charge the hyperdrive and calculate the jump at the same time…

...Can’t run the power rod refinery and fuel the reactor at the same time. So... yay. Here I am, outta gas. Talking to myself.

So… what are you gonna do, Val?

I’m gonna… hope, I guess? Go to sleep and hope somebody finds me? It’s not like I can do anything else.

So uh… yeah. Hi, new crewmates! I’m Valerie Fiorillo, but you can call me Val. I hope you’re nice.

...If you find me...
