I don’t know what happened. I think we were shot at or… I don’t know. Everyone’s…

...They’re dead. They’re dead and there’s a huge hole in the ship and I’m hiding in a hypersleep pod but it’s damaged, I think the lid’s gonna blow...

+Loud creaking sound: she sobs+

...La… La ʾilaha ʾilla llah Muḥammadun rasulu llah...

...Oh, God. Oh God! Mom, I love y-!
