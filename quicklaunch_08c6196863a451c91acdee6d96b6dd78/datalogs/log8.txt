Julian Briggs, personal log… final entry.

Fuck it, call it what it is. This is my… nngh... my… obituary. Damn pirates. I don’t know how I wanted to go but this ain’t it. Not shot in the gut. Not bleeding out.

Got the bastards, though. I’m the last man standing, heh… *coughs.*

...Except I ain’t standing.

The pirates are all dead… my crew are all dead… legs don’t work… and even if they did, I’m no kinda surgeon...

My only hope is hypersleep. Slim chance, but maybe if somebody finds me and gets me on a med table quick enough...

But we got the bastards. At least… at least that’s something. They won’t hurt anybody else. I hope that counts for… something...

I’m… I feel cold. So I… I guess I’m probably not gonna make it.

...Shit.
