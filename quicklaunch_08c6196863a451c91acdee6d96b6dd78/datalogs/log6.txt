Dammit, I’m a doctor, not a slave.

I don’t care what you assholes with the collars say. You people are monsters. Oh, you pretend you’re all civilized with your rules and fancy clothes… but you’re animals. Worse than animals. Animals don’t lock each other in cages, and they don’t murder anyone who tries to resist, either.

I never thought I’d be the kind of guy to take out bloody revenge. “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,” right? Well, sometimes justice is old-fashioned. So I hope you enjoy the nerve gas I cooked up for you.

There’s no point in panicking. You can’t escape. I sabotaged the airlocks, and the spacesuits. There’s only one room on this junk pile that’s safe, and I’m locked in here with the only functioning hypersleep chamber. I’m going to get on with the life you tried to ruin. Here’s hoping the crew who pick me up think I did the right thing by killing all of you.

It’s not like I ever took the Hippocratic Oath anyway.

So when you sons of bitches get to Hell… tell them Ted O’Connell sent you.

Good feckin’ riddance.
